# hello-world
I'm learning coding through Coursera and Python so I can work in Bioinformatics and Data Sciences. I'm starting this GitHub to record my projects, since online learning sometimes gets a bad rap and I want to prove that I can code! So here is where my projects will live.

Hopefully someday I'll be contributing to and working on some of the cool open-source stuff that's out there!
